# ClinVar

ClinVar is an NIH database that aggregates information about genomic variation and its relationship to human health. See [the ClinVar website](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/) for a description of the data in ClinVar and our data submitters.

ClinVar continues to be under active development. The ClinVar team uses this GitHub repository to make prototypes available to our users for review before they are put into production. This repository does not have comprehensive information about the production version of ClinVar; please visit [the ClinVar website](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/) for comprehensive information about the production database.

We are currently presenting [a prototype for improving how functional data are represented in ClinVar.](functional_data) We welcome your feedback on the prototype; please email your comments and questions to clinvar@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov rather than opening an issue in this repository.
