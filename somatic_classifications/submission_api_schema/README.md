# ClinVar Submission API

ClinVar's current Submission API schema is [submission_api_schema.json](submission_api_schema.json) and more details can be found [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/docs/api_http/).

We introduced some changes to the ClinVar Submission API schema to improve support for submission of somatic variants through the API.
<br />[New API submission Schema to support Somatic Variant Classifications](submission_api_schema.json).

We updated test endpoint, https://submit.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/apitest/v1/submissions, to use the new proposed schema on April 11<sup>th</sup> 2024 and the production endpoint,  https://submit.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/api/v1/submissions, on May 15<sup>th</sup> 2024. 
<br />If you have any comments or questions, please contact us at clinvar@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.

Similar to the somatic spreadsheet submission template, the new schema offers two types of classification for somatic variants: "oncogenicityClassification" and "clinicalImpactClassification".  More information about the types of classifications in ClinVar is available on our website: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/docs/clinsig/. Consequently, three new submission set objects are introduced: "oncogenicitySubmission" and "clinicalImpactSubmission" for somatic variants and "germlineSubmission" for germline variants. 
<br />*Note*: We plan to deprecate the "clinvarSubmission" submission set object in the future. Though this new schema remains backward compatible with the "clinvarSubmission", we strongly recommend transitioning to the equivalent "germlineSubmission".


Highlights of differences between submission set objects:
|Submission components|germlineSubmission|clinicalImpactSubmission|oncogenicitySubmission|
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
|Observation|Â |presenceOfSomaticVariantInNormalTissue <br> somaticVariantAlleleFraction|presenceOfSomaticVariantInNormalTissue <br> somaticVariantAlleleFraction|
|Conditions|drug response| | |
|Classification|germlineClassification <br> modeOfInheritance <br> customAssertionScore <br> explanationOfDrugResponse <br> explanationOfOtherGermlineClassification <br /> <br /> *All these properties use the term "germlineClassification" instead of "clinicalSignificance" (The term used in 'clinvarSubmission' object) |clinicalImpactClassification|oncogenicityClassification|
