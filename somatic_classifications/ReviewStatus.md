## Review status for germline classification on aggregate records (VCV and RCV)

Review status for germline classification on VCV and RCV records will be calculated as in the past, namely:
1. if there is a submitted record from a practice guideline or an expert panel, the review status from the submitted record (SCV) is used for the VCV and RCV records
2. otherwise, the review status is based on
    * whether any submitted record provided assertion criteria and evidence for the classification (or a public contact) and
    * whether the submitted records agree on the classification

## Review status for classification of oncogenicity on aggregate records (VCV and RCV)

Review status for classification of oncogenicity on VCV and RCV records will be calculated similar to germline classification, described above, except that we will look for agreement or conflicts in the oncogenicity classification.

## Review status for classification of somatic clinical impact on aggregate records (VCV and RCV)

Review status for classification of somatic clinical impact on VCV and RCV records will differ from germline and oncogenicity, in that we will not look for agreement or conflicts in the classification of clinical impact.

The rationale is that for a given variant, it will be typical for different tiers to be reported for different assertion types and different tumor types, so conflicts are not informative. 
So review status will be calculated as follows:
1. if there is a submitted record from a practice guideline or an expert panel, the review status from the submitted record (SCV) is used for the VCV and RCV records
2.  otherwise, the review status is based on whether any submitted record provided assertion criteria and evidence for the classification (or a public contact)
