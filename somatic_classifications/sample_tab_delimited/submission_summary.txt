3500	Pathogenic	Sep 25, 2022	This sequence change falls in intron 9 of the WT1 gene. It does not directly change the encoded amino acid sequence of the WT1 protein. RNA analysis indicates that this variant induces altered splicing and likely results in the loss of 3 amino acid residue(s), but is expected to preserve the integrity of the reading-frame. This variant is not present in population databases (gnomAD no frequency). This variant has been observed in individual(s) with WT1-related disorders (PMID: 9398852, 9499425, 29668062). In at least one individual the variant was observed to be de novo. This variant is also known as IVS9+4C>T. ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 3500). Variants that disrupt the consensus splice site are a relatively common cause of aberrant splicing (PMID: 17576681, 9536098). Studies have shown that this variant results in the activation of a cryptic splice site in exon 9 (PMID: 9398852, 12050205). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.
